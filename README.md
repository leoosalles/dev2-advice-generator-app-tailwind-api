# 🎲 Advice Generator App

**Advice Generator App** is a front-end project developed using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to deliver a sleek and interactive user experience. The application features a **responsive** layout that adapts seamlessly across devices and incorporates a dynamic **advice-fetching mechanism** powered by an external **API**. Users can generate randomized pieces of advice by interacting with a custom-styled dice button.

The project structure follows clean architectural principles, with modular separation of CSS, JavaScript, and image assets. Tailwind CSS was customized using theme layers to enhance design consistency and scalability. JavaScript handles API integration, DOM manipulation, and event-driven behavior for smooth user interaction.

This application was developed as part of a **Frontend Mentor challenge**, adopted by the **DevQuest course** to fulfill one of the tasks in the **Advanced JavaScript module**. It demonstrates proficiency in asynchronous operations, API integration, and modern component-based design.

## 🧱 HTML Structure (index.html)

```html
<body class="bg-appblue-950">
  <main class="h-screen flex justify-center items-center">

### 🔗 Linking Tailwind CSS
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/output.css">
```
**Purpose:**
Links the compiled Tailwind CSS stylesheet to the HTML document.

**Explanation:**
This line links the HTML page to the `output.css` file located in the `src/` directory. This file is automatically generated during the Tailwind build process, typically using tools like Tailwind CLI, PostCSS, or bundlers such as Vite, Webpack, or Parcel. In this project, **Vite** is used.

Instead of using the standard Tailwind directives like `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`, this project employs a modular approach using **layer-based imports**:
```css
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```
*The full structure and rationale behind this custom CSS configuration will be outlined in a dedicated section of this documentation.*

These imports allow precise control over how Tailwind’s styles are layered, giving priority and isolation to specific design tokens and style rules.

The `@theme` directive in this setup defines custom variables (such as colors), enabling consistent use across utility classes in your application. Vite then processes this configuration using its internal PostCSS integration, compiles all layers into one stylesheet, and outputs it as `output.css`.

By linking this compiled file in the HTML, the page gains access to all Tailwind utility classes, custom theme, and responsive design features—ensuring fast development, modular styling, and total design flexibility.

### 🧱 Body Content and Tailwind Classes

## 💡 JavaScript Logic (index.js)

### 1. Variables and Elements Selection

```js
const appBtn = document.getElementById('advice-btn');
```
**Purpose:**
Selects the advice button.

**Explanation:**
Used to attach an event listener to handle click events.

```js
const adviceId = document.getElementById('id-advice');
```
**Purpose:**
Selects the element that will display the advice ID.

**Explanation:**
Inner text is updated dynamically.

```js
const adviceText = document.getElementById('advice');
```
**Purpose:**
Selects the element that displays the advice.

**Explanation:**
Updated with the text returned from the API.<br><br>

### 2. Fetching Random Advice from External API

```js
async function getAdvice() {
```
**Purpose:**
Defines an async function to fetch data from the API.

**Explanation:**
Used to request random advice asynchronously.

```js
try {
```
**Purpose:**
Begins a block of code that will be monitored for errors.

**Explanation:**
If an error occurs in any line inside the try block (e.g., due to network failure or invalid JSON), the code will immediately jump to the corresponding catch block for error handling. This prevents the script from crashing and enables graceful fallback behavior.

```js
const url = "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice";
```
**Purpose:**
Declares the endpoint URL for the Advice Slip JSON API.

**Explanation:**
The URL is stored in a constant named url. This API returns a random piece of advice in JSON format. Storing it in a variable helps with readability and maintainability, especially if the URL needs to be reused or changed later.

```js
const response = await fetch(url);
```
**Purpose:**
Sends an HTTP GET request to the API and waits for the response.

**Explanation:**
The `fetch()` function initiates the network request to the given URL. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the async function until the response is received. The result is a `Response` object that contains metadata and the body of the HTTP response.

```js
if (!response.ok) {
```
**Purpose:**
Checks if the HTTP request was successful.

**Explanation:**
The `ok` property of the response object is `true` if the status code is in the 200–299 range. If it’s not, this indicates a problem like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Server Error), and the code inside the `if` block will run to handle the error.

```js
throw new Error("An error occurred while trying to fetch the information from the API")
```
**Purpose:**
Manually throws an error to be caught by the `catch` block.

**Explanation:**
If the response indicates a failed request, this line creates a new `Error` object with a custom message and halts the normal flow of execution, sending control to the `catch` block.

```js
const obj = await response.json();
```
**Purpose:**
Parses the response body as JSON.

**Explanation:**
The API returns the advice data in JSON format. The `await` ensures that the code waits for the asynchronous parsing to finish before assigning the result to the `obj` variable.

```js
return {
  id: obj.slip.id,
  advice: obj.slip.advice
};
```
**Purpose:**
Returns an object containing the extracted advice ID and advice text.

**Explanation:**
The response JSON has a structure like `{ slip: { id: ..., advice: ... } }`. This line returns only the relevant parts (`id` and `advice`) in a simplified object that the rest of the application can use easily.

```js
} catch (error) {
```
**Purpose:**
Begins the error-handling block that runs if any error occurs in the `try` block.

**Explanation:**
If an exception is thrown while fetching or parsing the data, execution jumps here. The `error` parameter captures the error object for inspection or logging.

```js
console.error("An error occurred while trying to fetch the information from the API:", error);
```
**Purpose:**
Logs an error message and details to the browser console.

**Explanation:**
This helps developers understand what went wrong during the fetch operation by showing a descriptive message and the actual error object.<br><br>

### 3. Display Advice with Loading and Error States

```js
async function renderAdvice() {
```
**Purpose:**
Declares an asynchronous function that fetches and displays a piece of advice.

**Explanation:**
The `async` keyword allows the use of `await` inside the function to handle asynchronous operations such as API calls. The function is designed to update the UI based on the result of the request to the advice API.

```js
try {
```
**Purpose:**
Begins a `try` block to handle possible errors gracefully.

**Explanation:**
If any part of the function throws an error (e.g., due to a failed API call), control will move to the `catch` block, preventing the application from crashing and allowing error messaging.

```js
adviceId.innerHTML = '...';
```
**Purpose:**
Temporarily sets the `adviceId` element’s content to an ellipsis while waiting for the API.

**Explanation:**
This provides visual feedback to the user that a new piece of advice is being loaded by showing `"..."` in the place of the advice ID.

```js
adviceText.innerHTML = 'Loading advice...';
```
**Purpose:**
Displays a loading message in the `adviceText` element.

**Explanation:**
Informs the user that the application is retrieving new data. This improves user experience by showing that the system is working.

```js
const data = await getAdvice();
```
**Purpose:**
Waits for the asynchronous `getAdvice()` function to return a new piece of advice.

**Explanation:**
The `await` keyword pauses the function until the API request is complete. The response, an object with `id` and `advice`, is stored in the data variable.

```js
adviceId.innerHTML = `Advice #${data.id}`;
```
**Purpose:**
Displays the fetched advice ID on the screen.

**Explanation:**
Updates the content of the `adviceId` element with a formatted string like `Advice #123`, making it clear which advice is currently shown.

```js
adviceText.innerHTML = `"${data.advice}"`;
```
**Purpose:**
Displays the fetched advice text in the `adviceText` element.

**Explanation:**
Shows the main content (the advice itself) to the user. The advice is wrapped in quotation marks to visually indicate that it's a spoken or written quote.

```js
} catch (err) {
```
**Purpose:**
Starts the error-handling block if something goes wrong in the `try` block.

**Explanation:**
If the API call fails, or if `getAdvice()` throws an error, execution jumps to this block. The `err` parameter contains the error object.

```js
adviceId.innerHTML = '!';
```
**Purpose:**
Displays an exclamation mark in the `adviceId` element to signal an error.

**Explanation:**
This simple symbol quickly communicates to the user that something went wrong while trying to load the advice.

```js
adviceText.innerHTML = 'Error. Try again.';
```
**Purpose:**
Displays a generic error message in the `adviceText` element.

**Explanation:**
Informs the user that the advice could not be loaded and encourages them to try again. This is essential for a good user experience.

```js
console.error("Error fetching advice:", err);
```
**Purpose:**
Logs the error message and the error object to the browser console.

**Explanation:**
Useful for debugging. Developers can inspect the error details in the console if something goes wrong during the advice fetching process.<br><br>

### 4. Trigger Advice Rendering on Button Click

```js
appBtn.addEventListener('click', renderAdvice);
```
**Purpose:**
Attaches a click event listener to the advice button.

**Explanation:**
This line listens for a `click` event on the button element referenced by `appBtn` (the dice button). When the button is clicked, the `renderAdvice` function is executed.
This enables users to retrieve a new piece of advice each time they interact with the button.

## 🎨 Custom Tailwind Configuration (input.css)

```css
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);

@theme {
    --color-appblue-200: hsl(193, 38%, 86%);
    --color-appgreen-300: hsl(150, 100%, 66%);
    --color-appblue-600: hsl(217, 19%, 38%);
    --color-appblue-900: hsl(217, 19%, 24%);
    --color-appblue-950: hsl(218, 23%, 16%);
}
```

The `input.css` file plays a **central role** in customizing Tailwind CSS for this project. Rather than using the conventional Tailwind directives like `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`, this project leverages **layer-based imports and custom theme variables**, offering enhanced **modularity**, **design scalability**, and **fine-grained control** over the generated utility classes.

This setup aligns with **Tailwind CSS's official documentation** for advanced theming using the `@theme` directive.

### 📄 File: `src/css/input.css`
```css
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
```
**Purpose:**
Declares the order in which the imported layers will be processed by Tailwind.

**Explanation:**
The `@layer` directive defines the stacking order of Tailwind’s styles. It ensures styles in the `theme`, `base`, `components`, and `utilities` layers are processed correctly and maintain predictable **cascading** behavior.

```css
@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
```
**Purpose:**
Imports the `theme` layer from Tailwind CSS.

**Explanation:**
This layer includes **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography, etc.) that form the foundation of the project design system. By importing it under `layer(theme)`, we’re telling Tailwind to treat its contents as `theme-level definitions`, enabling features like token-based utility generation (`bg-colorName`, `text-colorName`, etc.).

```css
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
```
**Purpose:**
Applies Tailwind’s CSS reset (Preflight) to normalize browser styles.

**Explanation:**
Preflight is Tailwind’s version of `normalize.css`. It removes inconsistencies across browsers by setting a baseline for how elements are rendered. This import ensures predictable layouts and typography behavior across platforms, inserted into the `base` layer.

```css
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```
**Purpose:**
Adds Tailwind’s full set of utility classes.

**Explanation:**
This is where Tailwind generates its atomic utility classes (`p-4`, `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, etc.). Including it in the `utilities` layer means these classes are available globally for use throughout the application.<br><br>

### 🎨 Custom Theme Variables
```css
@theme {
  --color-appblue-200: hsl(193, 38%, 86%);
  --color-appgreen-300: hsl(150, 100%, 66%);
  --color-appblue-600: hsl(217, 19%, 38%);
  --color-appblue-900: hsl(217, 19%, 24%);
  --color-appblue-950: hsl(218, 23%, 16%);
}
```
**Purpose:**
Defines custom color tokens used to generate Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-appblue-900`, `text-appgreen-300`).

**Explanation:**
The `@theme` directive allows us to define our **design system** directly in CSS using **CSS custom properties (variables)**. Tailwind reads these definitions and automatically generates corresponding utility classes like:

- `bg-appblue-950` → `background-color: hsl(218, 23%, 16%)`
- `text-appgreen-300` → `color: hsl(150, 100%, 66%)`

These tokens promote **visual consistency**, **easier maintenance**, and **faster prototyping**. Instead of relying on default Tailwind colors (like `bg-slate-800`), the project uses these branded tokens to build a coherent visual identity.

### Summary
- `input.css` defines **which Tailwind layers** are imported and in **what order**.
- It uses the **`@theme` directive** to define **custom color tokens**.
- This configuration is **compiled by Vite** (via PostCSS) into the `output.css` file, which is then linked in the HTML.
- By using this method, the project gains full control over its design system while staying modular and scalable.

This setup reflects modern best practices in Tailwind configuration and theming.
